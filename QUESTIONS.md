## 3.1 Understand the industry

### 3.1.1 Explain the money flow and the information flow in the acquirer market and the role of the main players.

#### Money Flow:
Customer -> Merchant -> Acquirer -> Card Network -> Issuing Bank -> Acquirer -> Merchant

Customer sends the information when making a purchase,
then the Merchant sends the information to the Acquirer to process the payment.
The Acquirer then forwards the information to the Card Network(Visa, Mastercard, etc)
The Card Network then acts as an intermediary between the Acquirer and the Issuing Bank, which holds the customer's account.
The Issuing Bank analyzes the transaction for approval or denial and respond to the Acquirer via the Card Network.
The final step is the communication from the Acquirer to the Merchant, if the transaction was approved,
the funds are transferred from the customer's account to the merchant's account.

#### Information Flow:

Customer -> Merchant -> Acquirer -> Card Network -> Issuing Bank -> Acquirer -> Merchant

The Customer sends it's card information to the Merchant.
The Merchant send this information along with the amount to the Acquirer.
The Acquirer send this information along with the information regarding the Issuing Bank to the Card Network.
The Card Network send the transaction details to the Issuing Bank for approval or denial.
The Issuing Bank then returns to the Acquirer the information via the Card Network,
including information regarding the approval and additional information.
The Acquirer then communicates back to the Merchant about the authorization or decline of the transaction.
If the transaction is declined, the Merchant is told to not proceed with the sale.

### 3.1.2 Explain the difference between acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway and how the flow explained in question 1 changes for these players.

Acquirer is process the payments, it processes credit or debit card payments on behalf of the merchant.

Sub-acquirer is a kind of intermediary player between the acquirer and the merchant.
It's role is similar to the Acquirer but it doesn't have the autonomy to perform all functionalities of an Acquirer.

Payment gateway is the system that sends data from the checkout at the Merchant to Acquirer, Card Brands and Issuing Banks.

### 3.1.3 Explain what chargebacks are, how they differ from cancellations and what is their connection with fraud in the acquiring world.

Chargeback is when a customer disputes the transaction and the funds return to the customer's card account.
Credit card chargeback is considered a consumer protection.

Cancellation is done in a friendly way between the customer and the merchant.

Usually the customer does a chargeback after trying to Cancel in a friendly way with the merchant
but the merchant refuses the cancellation.

Anti-fraud is a system that analyzes in an attempt to identify fraudulent transactions.
It analyzes behavior of users and with a series of rules and patterns defines if it's valid or fraudulent  transaction.

### 3.2.2 In addition to the spreadsheet data, what other data would you look at to try to find patterns of possible frauds?
- IP address
- Geolocation

### 3.3 Solve the Problem

This is the explanation around the whole Recommendation model (app/model/recommendation.rb).

It will look into past Transactions and other specific params to approve or deny the Transaction.
Independently we will save the transaction, for future references (in case User is trying to commit fraud)

This is an explanation around all checks:

- Check if there is any other Transaction for the user that has the flag `has_cbk` set to `TRUE`;
- Check if the current time is after midnight and before dawn plus the amount is too high;
- Check if user had any Transaction in past hour;
- Check if the sum of Transactions in last 5 hours is above the 5 hour limit amount;
- Check if the sum of Transactions in last 90 minutes is above the 90 minutes limit amount;
- Check if the Transaction's amount is the same as previous Transactions in past 90 minutes;
- Check if User made Transactions in multiple devices in last 90 minutes;
- Check if User made Transactions in same device multiple times in last 90 minutes

#### TODO:
- Check Merchant's history transactions
- Check Device's history transactions

If any of these checks is true, the recommendation will be `deny`.

If all the checks are negative, the recommendation will be `approve`.
